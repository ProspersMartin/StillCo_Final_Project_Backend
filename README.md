# StillCo_Final_Project_Backend  
This is the fully functional Back End of the web application for The Still Collective - "A marketplace for on-demand branding and business consulting services where clients and professionals meet". I designed the application's data structure and models, and successfully connected tht database tables to corresponding parts in Front End.

## Build  
Python, SQL, MySQL, SQLAlchemy, Flask, and Postman were used for this application's Back End development.

## Deployment
