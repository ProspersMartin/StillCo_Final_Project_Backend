# Creating a Database

1. Login in into your mysql terminal:
```sh
$ mysql
```
2. Once inside, type the following command replacing your db name
```sql
CREATE DATABASE example;
```

Make sure to update the `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` on the `.env` file with the correct database name.

You can keep running any SQL command or type `exit;` to quit.
